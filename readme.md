# Emergency Services Bot

A bot designed to allow for rapid deployment of a question and answer service with support for multiple languages and accessible over web and SMS.

## Background

Disaster response scenarios require time-critical response to provide relief to affected individuals.  Inspired by the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, this project serves as a disaster response question and answer service to provide assistance for victims of natural disaster.  The service allows for an operator to quickly plug in question and answer responses into a knowledge base which become auto-translated to end users of the service. The project also provides out of box support for Web and SMS allowing for increased availability to individuals who may not have internet access.

## Styling the bot

Within the include default.htm, there is an example of a landing page for the bot: 

* Custom styling of the bot's look and feel are controlled by "/Content/botchat.css"
